 * it to also handle traversal of fragments and Backstage specific things like the
 * `FeatureFlagged` component.
 *
 * The return value of the hook is computed by the provided filter function, but
 * with added memoization based on the input `node`. If further memoization
 * dependencies are used in the filter function, they should be added to the
 * third `dependencies` argument, just like `useMemo`, `useEffect`, etc.
